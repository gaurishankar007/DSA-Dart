## Big O

`Big O` notation in DSA is a way to measure the efficiency of algorithms.
It provides a standardized method to express how the time or space taken by an algorithm grows with the size of the input.

- `Time Complexity:` Describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales with input size.
  - `O(1)` -> Constant time
  - `O(log n)` -> Logarithmic time
  - `O(n)` -> Linear time
  - `O(n^2), O(n^3)` -> Polynomial time
  - `O(2^n), O(n!)` -> Exponential time
- `Space Complexity:` Describes how the memory usage of an algorithm scales with input size.
  - `O(1)` -> Constant space
  - `O(n)` -> Linear space
  - `O(n^2), O(n^3)` -> Polynomial space
  - `O(log n), O(n log n)` -> Logarithmic or linearithmic space

Understanding `Big O` helps in choosing efficient algorithms and data structures,
crucial for optimizing performance, especially with large datasets or performance-critical applications.
